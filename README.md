zoho sprints workflow

# Overview
This repository follows an Agile development methodology using Zoho Sprints to manage tasks, track progress, and ensure timely delivery of project milestones. Zoho Sprints is an intuitive project management tool that empowers teams to organize sprints, collaborate effectively, and continuously improve their processes.

# Workflow Description #
1. Backlog Management
All new tasks, bugs, or features are added to the Backlog in Zoho Sprints.
Each item in the backlog is detailed with a title, description, and priority (High, Medium, Low).
Additional attributes like tags, story points, and owner are added to provide clarity.
2. Sprint Planning
At the beginning of each sprint cycle, backlog items are reviewed during a Sprint Planning Meeting.
The team selects items to include in the upcoming sprint based on priority and team capacity.
Sprint objectives and duration (usually 1-4 weeks) are defined during planning.
3. Task Assignment
Items in the sprint are assigned to team members based on their expertise and workload.
Tasks are broken down into manageable subtasks if necessary.
Each task is associated with a status (To Do, In Progress, Testing, Done).
4. Daily Scrum
The team participates in daily standup meetings to discuss:
Progress on current tasks.
Any blockers or challenges.
Plans for the day.
Updates are reflected in Zoho Sprints, ensuring real-time status tracking.
5. Progress Tracking
The team uses Zoho Sprints' Kanban Board to monitor the flow of tasks across different stages.
Burndown Charts and Velocity Reports provide insights into sprint progress and team performance.
6. Testing and Quality Assurance
Once a task is marked as Ready for Testing, it moves to the QA team's workflow.
Test cases are documented and executed. Any bugs identified are linked back to the task in Zoho Sprints.
After successful testing, tasks are marked as Done.
7. Sprint Review and Retrospective
At the end of the sprint, the team conducts a Sprint Review Meeting to demo completed work.
Feedback is collected from stakeholders, and unfinished tasks are moved back to the backlog.
A Sprint Retrospective Meeting is held to discuss:
What went well.
What didnâ€™t go well.
Actionable steps for improvement in the next sprint.
